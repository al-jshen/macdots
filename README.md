system monitor (right side of bar) adapted from blahsd/supernerd.widget  
spaces (left side of bar) adapted from u/historybuffjb's modification of kkga/nibar  

iterm theme: one-dark  
terminal prompt: pure  
nvim theme: one-dark  
nvim plugin manager: zplugin  
window manager: yabai  
bar: ubersicht  


**to do:**

prevent switching to a space that is currently focused (causes spaces part of bar to crash)  
prevent overflow of bar (spaces part of bar grows with number of apps open)
